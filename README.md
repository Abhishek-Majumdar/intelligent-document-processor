## Information Extraction from documents

POC project to explore processing of structured(invoices, legal documents)  as well as unstructured documents(handwritten prescriptions, notes) to extract relevant fields and related information. 

Both rule based & intelligent models are being explored. For specific use cases, rule based models are faster to develop & more accurate while AI models look like a solution for the larger and more generalized sample space.

Python is used for implementation.
Possible solutions involving : **Deep Learning/Computer Vision/NLP/Regex**
